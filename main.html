	<p class = "selector">Nagpur is one of the most prominent parliamentary constituencies, the seat for which is currently held by the Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways of India and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Nitin Gadkari.</p>
	<p>The battle in Nagpur is going to be one of the most watched races not only in the state but in the country, with Gadkari who has a legion of supporters and is said to be a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) loyalist.</p>
	<p class = "selector">Once a champion of Congress, in 2014, Gadkari defeated seven-time Member of Parliament (MP) Vilas Muttemwar by a margin of 28 million votes. He also managed to retain his seat after defeating current Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole by 21.6 million votes, in 2019.</p>
	<p>The Congress candidate has brought up issues like unemployment, inflation, lack of basic amenities, and local issues on the campaign trail. He has also taken shots at Gadkari saying that only building bridges and metros “do not mean development”.</p>
